My website through the ages.

sliding
=======
My first "real" website. It looks like it came from the late 90s. I was really hesitant to redo it.

Scrapped as of mid 2011.

purple
======
My first idea of what would be kinda "neat" (and also the most recent version I had). It uses tiles and some sliding effects to display content, though it renders poorly on mobile. 

Scrapped as of September 2013.

nodes
=====
Everything is a node, interconnected. Relevant nodes hide and show as the mouse moves to them, and external links are provided for information as necessary. It renders better on mobile.
