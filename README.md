purple
======
My first idea of what would be kinda "neat" (and also the most recent version I had). It uses tiles and some sliding effects to display content, though it renders poorly on mobile. 

Scrapped as of September 2013.


nodes
=====
Everything is a node, interconnected. Relevant nodes hide and show as the mouse moves to them, and external links are provided for information as necessary.
