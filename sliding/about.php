		<p>At the time of writing, I am a 20 year old junior at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh. I study Computer Science, with an emphasis in software engineering. But that's all the boring stuff.</p>
		<p>
		For the last 6 years, I've worked on <a target="_blank" href="http://code.google.com/u/imnothere199/">various projects</a>, on and off. I've made several games over the course of that time, some I am content with, and others that need not see the light of day. I also do a lot of work with IRC bots, creating everything from games to utilities and even some bots that are a mix. I've dabbled in too many languages to count, but above all, I work with <a target="_blank" href="http://byond.com">Dream Maker</a> and Java. A lot of this website is done with PHP, too.
