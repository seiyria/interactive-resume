I'm going to start you off with some commands to tell the bot:<br />
/msg IdleMaster register YourCharacterName YourPassword YourCustomClassName<br />
/msg IdleMaster login YourCharacterName YourPassword<br />
/msg IdleMaster gender male|female<br /><br />
Now you're all logged in, and you'll be on your way to leveling up in due time. Eventually, you'll have a large sum of gold. What can you do with gold? You can buy items, of course! You can find a list of items, buyable and not, in the 'shop' section.
